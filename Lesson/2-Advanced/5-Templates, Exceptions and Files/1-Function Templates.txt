Function Templates


Functions and classes help to make programs easier to write, safer, and more maintainable.
However, while functions and classes do have all of those advantages, in certain cases they can also be somewhat limited by C++'s requirement that you specify types for all of your parameters.

For example, you might want to write a function that calculates the sum of two numbers, similar to this:

int sum(int a, int b) {
  return a+b;
}

!You can use templates to define functions as well as classes. Let's see how they work.

->int sum(int a, int b){
  return a + b;
}


We can now call the function for two integers in our main.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int sum(int a, int b) {
    return a+b;
}

int main () {
    int x=7, y=15;
    cout << sum(x, y) << endl;
}

!The function works as expected, but is limited solely to integers.

->int main(){
 int x = 7;
 int y = 11;
  cout << sum(x, y) << endl;
}

It becomes necessary to write a new function for each new type, such as doubles.
double sum(double a, double b) {
  return a+b;
}
Wouldn't it be much more efficient to be able to write one version of sum() to work with parameters of any type?
Function templates give us the ability to do that!
With function templates, the basic idea is to avoid the necessity of specifying an exact type for each variable. Instead, C++ provides us with the capability of defining functions using placeholder types, called template type parameters.

To define a function template, use the keyword template, followed by the template type definition:

template <class T> 

!We named our template type T, which is a generic data type.

->template <class MyType>

Now we can use our generic data type T in the function:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

template <class T>
T sum(T a, T b) {
    return a+b;
}

int main () {
    int x=7, y=15;
    cout << sum(x, y) << endl;
}

The function returns a value of the generic type T, taking two parameters, also of type T.
!Our new function worked exactly as the previous one for integer values did.

-> template <class T>
T sum( T a, T b){
return a + b;
}

The same function can be used with other data types, for example doubles:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

template <class T>
T sum(T a, T b) {
    return a+b;
}

int main () {
    double x=7.15, y=15.54;
    cout << sum(x, y) << endl;
}

The compiler automatically calls the function for the corresponding type.

!When creating a template type parameter, the keyword typename may be used as an alternative to the keyword class: template <typename T>.
In this context, the keywords are identical, but throughout this course, we'll use the keyword class.

->int main(){
double a = 4.3;
double b = 7.2;
 cout << sum(a, b) << endl;
}

Template functions can save a lot of time, because they are written only once, and work with different types.
Template functions reduce code maintenance, because duplicate code is reduced significantly.

!Enhanced safety is another advantage in using template functions, since it's not necessary to manually copy functions and change types.

->template <class T>
void myFunction(T arg){
    cout << arg << endl;
}
