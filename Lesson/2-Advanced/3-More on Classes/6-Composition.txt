Composition


In the real world, complex objects are typically built using smaller, simpler objects. For example, a car is assembled using a metal frame, an engine, tires, and a large number of other parts. This process is called composition.

In C++, object composition involves using classes as member variables in other classes.
This sample program demonstrates composition in action. It contains Person and Birthday classes, and each Person will have a Birthday object as its member.
Birthday:

class Birthday {
 public:
  Birthday(int m, int d, int y)
  : month(m), day(d), year(y)
  { 
  }
 private:
   int month;
   int day;
   int year;
};

Our Birthday class has three member variables. It also has a constructor that initializes the members using a member initialization list.

!The class was declared in a single file for the sake of simplicity. Alternatively, you could use header and source files.

->Birthday::Birthday(int m, int d, int y)
: month(m), 
 day(d),
 year(y)
 { 
 }


 Let's also add a printDate() function to our Birthday class:

 class Birthday {
 public:
  Birthday(int m, int d, int y)
  : month(m), day(d), year(y)
  {
  }
  void printDate()
  {
   cout<<month<<"/"<<day
   <<"/"<<year<<endl;
  }
 private:
  int month;
  int day;
  int year;
};

!Add a printDate() function to our Birthday class.

->class People{
    public: 
        People();
    private:
        int Birthday;
        int BirtMonth;
        int BirtYear;
};


 Next, we can create the Person class, which includes the Birthday class.

 #include <string>
#include "Birthday.h"

class Person {
 public:
  Person(string n, Birthday b)
  : name(n),
   bd(b)
  {
  }
 private:
  string name;
  Birthday bd;
};

The Person class has a name and a Birthday member, and a constructor to initialize them.
Ensure that the corresponding header files are included.

->#include <string>
#include "Birthday.h"
class People {
public:
 People(string n, Birthday bo);
private:
 string name;
 Birthday dateOfBirth;
};
