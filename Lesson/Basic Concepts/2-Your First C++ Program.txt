Your First C++ Program


Let's output "Hello world!" to the screen!
To do that, we will add cout << "Hello world!"; line to our main() function body:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    cout << "Hello world!";
    return 0;
}

cout is the stream object used to perform output on the standard output device which is usually the display screen.
cout is used in combination with the insertion operator <<.

!In C++, streams are used to perform input and output operations.

->Drag and drop the options to output "Hello, world!" on the screen:
cout << "Hello, world!";


You can add multiple insertion operators after cout.
For example:

cout << "Hello,\nworld!" << endl;
cout << "This "
     << "is "
     << "awesome!" << endl;

!In C++, the semicolon is used to terminate a statement. Each statement must end with a semicolon. It indicates the end of one logical expression.

->Each instruction must end with a: semicolon ( ; )
