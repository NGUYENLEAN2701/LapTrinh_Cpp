Arithmetic Operators


C++ supports these arithmetic operators.


Addition        | + | x+y
Subtraction     | - | x-y
Multiplication  | * | x*y
Division        | / | x/y
Modulus         | % | x%y

->int x;

x = 4 + 6;

cout << x << endl;

->int x = 24;

int y;

y = x - 12;

cout << y << endl;

->*

->int x = 81 / 3;

cout << x;

->%



Operator Precedence


Operator precedence determines the grouping of terms in an expression, which affects how an expression is evaluated. Certain operators take higher precedence over others; for example, the multiplication operator has higher precedence over the addition operator.
For example:

sử dụng dấu () để xác định thứ tự phép tính:

int x = 5+2*2; //-> x=9
int x = (5+2)*2; //-> x=14


->int x = ( 4 + 3 ) * 2;

cout << x;


Parentheses force the operations to have higher precedence. If there are parenthetical expressions nested within one another, the expression within the innermost parentheses is evaluated first.


!If none of the expressions are in parentheses, multiplicative (multiplication, division, modulus) operators will be evaluated before additive (addition, subtraction) operators.
