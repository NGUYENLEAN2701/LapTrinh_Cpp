New Line


The cout object does not insert a line break at the end of the output.
One way to print two lines is to use the endl manipulator, which will put in a line break.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    cout << "Hello world!" << endl;
    cout << "I love programming!";
    return 0;
}

->What should be used to move to a new line? endl


The new line character \n can be used as an alternative to endl.
Using a single cout statement with as many instances of \n as your program requires will print out multiple lines of text.

Example:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    cout << "Hello world!\n";
    cout << "I Love programming!\n" << "I Love C++" << endl;
    return 0;
}


!The backslash (\) is called an escape character, and indicates a "special" character.
