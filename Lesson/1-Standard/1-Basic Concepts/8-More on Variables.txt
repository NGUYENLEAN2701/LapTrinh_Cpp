Variables


Specifying the data type is required just once, at the time when the variable is declared.
After that, the variable may be used without referring to the data type.

int a;
a = 10;

!Specifying the data type for a given variable more than once results in a syntax error.

->How many times should a data type be mentioned for a variable? 
Only once: when declaring the variable


A variable's value may be changed as many times as necessary throughout the program.

For example:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int a = 100;
    a = 50;
    cout << a;
    return 0;
}

->int a = 15;

int b = a;

cout << a + b << endl;
