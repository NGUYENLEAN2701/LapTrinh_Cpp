Welcome to C++

C++ is a popular cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications - operating systems, browsers, video-games, art applications and so on.

!C++ was derived from C, and is largely based on it.

->C++ is a: General purpose programming language


A C++ program is a collection of commands or statements.

Below is a simple program template.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{

  return 0;
}

You will learn what each of the statements does in the upcoming lessons.
For now, remember that the entry point of every C++ program is the main() function, irrespective of what the program does.

!Curly brackets { } indicate the beginning and end of a function, which can also be called the function's body. The information inside the brackets indicates what the function does when executed.

->Which of the following is the entry point of every C++ program? int main()
