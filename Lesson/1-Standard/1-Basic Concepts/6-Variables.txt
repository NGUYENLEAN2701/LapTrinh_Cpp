Variables


Creating a variable reserves a memory location, or a space in memory for storing values. The compiler requires that you provide a data type for each variable you declare.
C++ offer a rich assortment of built-in as well as user defined data types.

Integer, a built-in type, represents a whole number value. Define integer using the keyword int.
C++ requires that you specify the type and the identifier for each variable defined.
An identifier is a name for a variable, function, class, module, or any other user-defined item. An identifier starts with a letter (A-Z or a-z) or an underscore (_), followed by additional letters, underscores, and digits (0 to 9).
For example, define a variable called myVariable that can hold integer values as follows:

int myVariable = 10; 

!Different operating systems can reserve different sizes of memory for the same data type.
