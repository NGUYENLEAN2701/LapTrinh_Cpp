Decision Making


The if statement is used to execute some code if a condition is true.

Syntax:

if (condition) {
   statements
}

The condition specifies which expression is to be evaluated. If the condition is true, the statements in the curly brackets are executed.


!If the condition is false, the statements are simply ignored, and the program continues to run after the if statements body.


->if (test) { }


Use relational operators to evaluate conditions.

For example:
if(7>4){
   cout << "Yes";
}

The if statement evaluates the condition (7>4), finds it to be true, and then executes the cout statement.
If we change the greater operator to a less than operator (7<4), the statement will not be executed and nothing will be printed out.

!A condition specified in an if statement does not require a semicolon.

->int x = 5;
int y = 3;
if (x > y) {

  cout << "hi there";

}

Relational Operators


>= Lớn hơn hoặc bằng 7>=4 !true
<= nhỏ hơn hoặc bằng 7<=4 !false
== bằng 7>=4 !false
>= Lớn hơn hoặc bằng 7>=4 !true

example:

if(10==10){
   cout << "Yes";
}
-> ==;

->int x = 10;

int y = 8;

if (x != y) {

 cout << "not equal";

}


->int a = 98;
int b = 76;
if (a > b) {
  cout << "greatest is " << a << endl;
}

if (b > a) {
  cout << "greatest is " << b << endl;
}
