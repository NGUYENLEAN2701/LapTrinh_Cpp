Logical Operators


Use logical operators to combine conditional statements and return true or false.


&& : and 
|| : or 
!  : not 

!In the AND operator, both operands must be true for the entire expression to be true.

->int age = 23;
int money = 4;
if (age > 21 && money > 500) {
 cout << "welcome" << endl;
}
The AND Operator
For example:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int age = 20;
    if (age > 16 && age < 60) {
        cout << "Accepted!" << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
In the example above, the logical AND operator was used to combine both expressions.
!The expression in the if statement evaluates to true only if both expressions are true.

->Both a and b are true

->As many as you want


->int age = 26;
int money = 4;
if (age > 21 || money > 500) {
 cout << "welcome" << endl;
}
->Either a or b is true
Both a and b are true
