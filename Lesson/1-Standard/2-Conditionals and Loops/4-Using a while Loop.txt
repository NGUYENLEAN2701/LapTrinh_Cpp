Using Increment or Decrement


The increment or decrement operators can be used to change values in the loop.
For example:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int num = 1;
    while (num < 6) {
        cout << "Number: " << num << endl;
        num++;
    }
    
    return 0;
}

!num++ is equivalent to num = num + 1.


->int x = 1;

while (x <= 5) {

  cout << x << endl;

  x++;

}

A loop can be used to obtain multiple inputs from the user.
Let's create a program that allows the user to enter a number 5 times, each time storing the input in a variable.


int num = 1;
int number;

while (num <= 5) {
  cin >> number;
  num++;
}

!The above code asks for user input 5 times, and each time saves the input in the number variable.

->int x = 1;

int number;

while (x <= 5) {
 
cin >> number;

 x++;

}


Now let's modify our code to calculate the sum of the numbers the user has entered.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int num = 1;
    int number;
    int total = 0;

    while (num <= 5) {
        cin >> number;
        total += number;
        num++;
    }
    cout << total << endl;

    return 0;
}

The code above adds the number entered by the user to the total variable with each loop iteration.
Once the loop stops executing, the value of total is printed. This value is the sum of all of the numbers the user entered.

!Note that the variable total has an initial value of 0.


->int x = 1;

int number;

int total = 0;

while (x <= 5) {

  cin >> number;

  total = total + number;

  x++;

}

cout << "Sum: " << total << endl;
