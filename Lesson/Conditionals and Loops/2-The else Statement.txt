The else Statement

An if statement can be followed by an optional else statement, which executes when the condition is false.
Syntax:

if (condition) {
  //statements
}
else {
 //statements
}

The code above will test the condition:
- If it evaluates to true, then the code inside the if statement will be executed.
- If it evaluates to false, then the code inside the else statement will be executed.

!When only one statement is used inside the if/else, then the curly braces can be omitted.

->int age = 25;

if (age > 18) {

   cout << "Adult";

}

example:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int mark = 90;

    if (mark < 50) {
        cout << "You failed." << endl;
    }
    else {
        cout << "You passed." << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}

->int x = 22;

if (x > 33) {

 cout << "x is greater than 33" << endl;

} else {

 cout << "x is not greater than 33" << endl;

}

In all previous examples only one statement was used inside the if/else statement, but you may include as many statements as you want.

For example:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int mark = 90;

    if (mark < 50) {
        cout << "You failed." << endl;
        cout << "Sorry" << endl;
    }
    else {
        cout << "Congratulations!" << endl;
        cout << "You passed." << endl;
        cout << "You are awesome!" << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}

->as many as you want



You can also include, or nest, if statements within another if statement.
For example:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int mark = 100;

    if (mark >= 50) {
        cout << "You passed." << endl;
        if (mark == 100) {
            cout <<"Perfect!" << endl;
        }
    }
    else {
        cout << "You failed." << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}

->if ... cout 

C++ provides the option of nesting an unlimited number of if/else statements.
For example:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int age = 18;
    if (age > 14) {
        if(age >= 18) {
            cout << "Adult";
        }
        else {
            cout << "Teenager";
        }
    }
    else {
        if (age > 0) {
            cout << "Child";
        }
        else {
            cout << "Something's wrong";
        }
    }

    return 0;
}


!Remember that all else statements must have corresponding if statements.

->as many as you want

In if/else statements, a single statement can be included without enclosing it into curly braces.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int a = 10;
    if (a > 4)
        cout << "Yes";
    else
        cout << "No";

    return 0;
}

->int x = 10;

int y = 20;

if (x > y) {

  cout << "some other text" << endl;

} else {

  cout << "printing in the else" << endl;

}
