Decision Making


The if statement is used to execute some code if a condition is true.

Syntax:

if (condition) {
   statements
}

The condition specifies which expression is to be evaluated. If the condition is true, the statements in the curly brackets are executed.


!If the condition is false, the statements are simply ignored, and the program continues to run after the if statements body.


->if (test) { }
