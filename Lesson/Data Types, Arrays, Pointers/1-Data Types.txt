->Data types are intended to: Define the proper use of an identifier

->Which of the following expressions are legal in C++? 12+4


Numeric data types include:
Integers (whole numbers), such as -7, 42.
Floating point numbers, such as 3.14, -42.67.


->Which of the following are correct values for the numeric data types?1000 3.14

A string is composed of numbers, characters, or symbols. String literals are placed in double quotation marks; some examples are "Hello", "My name is David", and similar.

Characters are single letters or symbols, and must be enclosed between single quotes, like 'a', 'b', etc.


->Which one is a legal character, not a string? 't'

The Boolean data type returns just two possible values: true (1) and false (0).

->What is the result of 10 == 10 operation? Is it true or false? true

Strings


A string is an ordered sequence of characters, enclosed in double quotation marks.
It is part of the Standard Library.
You need to include the <string> library to use the string data type. Alternatively, you can use a library that includes the string library.


#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    string a = "I am learning C++";
    return 0;
}

!The <string> library is included in the <iostream> library, so you don't need to include <string> separately, if you already use <iostream>.

->#include <string>





Characters


A char variable holds a 1-byte integer. However, instead of interpreting the value of the char as an integer, the value of a char variable is typically interpreted as an ASCII character.

A character is enclosed between single quotes (such as 'a', 'b', etc).
For example:
char test = 'S';


!American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) is a character-encoding scheme that is used to represent text in computers.

->char var = 'z';


Booleans


Boolean variables only have two possible values: true (1) and false (0).
To declare a boolean variable, we use the keyword bool.


bool online = false;
bool logged_in = true;

!If a Boolean value is assigned to an integer, true becomes 1 and false becomes 0.
If an integer value is assigned to a Boolean, 0 becomes false and any value that has a non-zero value becomes true.


->bool a = false;
bool b = true;




Variable Naming Rules

Use the following rules when naming variables:
- All variable names must begin with a letter of the alphabet or an underscore( _ ).
- After the initial letter, variable names can contain additional letters, as well as numbers. Blank spaces or special characters are not allowed in variable names.


!There are two known naming conventions:
Pascal case: The first letter in the identifier and the first letter of each subsequent concatenated word are capitalized. For example: BackColor
Camel case: The first letter of an identifier is lowercase and the first letter of each subsequent concatenated word is capitalized. For example: backColor

->Which is a correct rule for naming a variable? Cannot start with a number


Case-Sensitivity


C++ is case-sensitive, which means that an identifier written in uppercase is not equivalent to another one with the same name in lowercase.
For example, myvariable is not the same as MYVARIABLE and not the same as MyVariable.
These are three different variables.


!Choose variable names that suggest the usage, for example: firstName, lastName.

->Which of the following are legal variable names in C++? salary name3_var 




Variable Naming Rules


C++ keyword (reserved word) cannot be used as variable names.
For example, int, float, double, cout cannot be used as a variable name.


!There is no real limit on the length of the variable name (depends on the environment), but try to keep your variable names practical and meaningful.

->int var3;
double salary;
bool ab_c14;
